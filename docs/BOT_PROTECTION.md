# Bot Protection for NextBuy E-commerce Application

This document outlines the bot protection features implemented in the NextBuy e-commerce application to prevent automated attacks, scraping, and abuse.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Behavioral Bot Analysis
- Tracks user interactions including mouse movements, click patterns, and form filling speed
- Scores user behavior to identify suspicious patterns
- Stores behavioral data in MongoDB for analysis and pattern recognition

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Global rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Stricter rate limiting on authentication routes
- IP-based and user-agent-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### 3. User Verification
- Google reCAPTCHA v2 integration on signup and login pages
- Automatic CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious behavior
- CAPTCHA required for checkout process to prevent automated purchases

### 4. Device Fingerprinting
- Client-side fingerprinting using FingerprintJS
- Server-side fingerprint validation and tracking
- Persistent tracking of devices across sessions

### 5. Navigation Analysis
- Tracks user navigation patterns
- Analyzes mouse movement patterns for bot-like behavior
- Identifies unnatural interaction patterns

### 6. Honeypot Traps
- Hidden form fields that only bots would fill out
- Fake endpoints that legitimate users wouldn't access
- Silent failure for detected bots to prevent detection

### 7. Database Integration
- MongoDB collection for bot detection metrics
- Tracks suspicious activity and patterns
- Allows for analysis and reporting of bot activity

### 8. IP Address Analysis
- Analyzes IP addresses for suspicious patterns
- Identifies high-risk sources and geographic anomalies
- Increases scrutiny for suspicious IP addresses

### 9. Headless Browser Detection
- Detects common headless browser signatures
- Identifies automation tools like Puppeteer, Selenium, etc.
- Blocks requests from known automation tools

### 10. Interaction Speed Analysis
- Measures form fill speed and interaction timing
- Identifies unnaturally fast interactions
- Flags suspicious interaction patterns

## Implementation Details

### Server-side Protection

The server-side protection is implemented as middleware in Express:

- `botProtection.js`: Contains middleware for rate limiting, headless browser detection, IP analysis, and behavioral analysis
- `botProtectionRoutes.js`: API endpoints for CAPTCHA verification and behavioral data logging
- `BotDetection.js`: MongoDB model for storing bot detection metrics

### Client-side Protection

The client-side protection is implemented using React components and utilities:

- `botProtection.js`: Utility functions for tracking user behavior and device fingerprinting
- `CaptchaVerification.jsx`: Component for displaying and handling CAPTCHA challenges
- `BotProtectedRoute.jsx`: Higher-order component for protecting routes from bots
- `HoneypotForm.jsx`: Component for adding honeypot fields to forms

## Usage

### Protecting Routes

To protect a route from bots, wrap it with the `BotProtectedRoute` component:

```jsx
<BotProtectedRoute>
  <YourComponent />
</BotProtectedRoute>
```

To require CAPTCHA verification for a route:

```jsx
<BotProtectedRoute requireCaptcha={true}>
  <YourComponent />
</BotProtectedRoute>
```

### Adding Honeypot to Forms

To add honeypot protection to a form, use the `HoneypotForm` component:

```jsx
<HoneypotForm onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* Your form fields */}
</HoneypotForm>
```

### Initializing Bot Protection

Bot protection is automatically initialized in the main App component:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  initBotProtection();
}, []);
```

## Configuration

### reCAPTCHA

Replace the test site key with your actual Google reCAPTCHA site key:

```jsx
<ReCAPTCHA
  sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE"
  onChange={handleCaptchaChange}
/>
```

### Rate Limiting

Adjust rate limiting settings in `server/middleware/botProtection.js`:

```javascript
export const apiRateLimit = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  // ...
});
```

## Monitoring and Analysis

Bot detection metrics are stored in the MongoDB database and can be analyzed to:

1. Identify attack patterns
2. Adjust protection thresholds
3. Generate reports on bot activity
4. Improve detection algorithms

## Future Enhancements

1. Machine learning-based bot detection
2. Integration with third-party bot detection services
3. Real-time monitoring dashboard
4. Automated IP blacklisting
5. Advanced behavioral biometrics
